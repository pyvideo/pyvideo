    "description": "Treehugging\n\nPresented by Brian Luft\n\nHierarchical data sprouts up almost everywhere, but not all trees look alike.\nLearn to how tell them apart and love them all in Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk would cover some common examples of hierarchical data in web\napplications and then review solutions like django-mptt and django-treebeard.\nRather than trying to cover tree algorithms in-depth, the focus would be on\nbest practices for querying and rendering trees in your Django apps.\n\nThis talk is not geared for the smart kids; they already know this stuff. It\nis intended to help less experienced developers take advantage of patterns\nwithout needing to worry about the deeper concepts.\n\n",
