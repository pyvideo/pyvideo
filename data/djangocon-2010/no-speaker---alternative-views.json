    "description": "Alternative views\n\nBen Firshman\n\nExploring the power of class-based views, their current status and how the\nconcepts behind them can be applied to other areas.\n\nAbstract\n\nGeneric views are quickly outgrown for all but the most simple of\napplications. They are often rewritten from scratch just to make small changes\nto functionality.\n\nIf you use class-based views, code can be reused by inheriting from more\nabstract views. They are provided with many reusable applications, but all\nimplemented in slightly different ways. It has been suggested a set of views\nbe supplied with Django to standardise the API.\n\nI will present some of the advantages and disadvantages of using class-based\nviews, and how they can help you develop more flexible applications in less\ntime.\n\n",
