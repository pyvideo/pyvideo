This talk will show how to display and interact with maps of\nimaginary lands, such as game maps or lands in science fiction novels. We'll\nuncover a bit of how Django GIS works in the process, separating the map\ndisplay from the modeling.\n\nAbstract\n\nWhilst django.contrib.gis isn't particularly difficult to get started with,\nparticularly if you follow the tutorials, it can sometimes seem a bit\noverwhelming in the way it goes from zero to fancy maps in only a couple of\nsteps. I'd like to demystify some of the pieces of the stack, pulling apart\nthe modeling support \u2014 specifying the data are we trying to work with \u2014 from\nthe display and client-side portion.\n\nTo make this more than a dry technical dive, I'll show how to add extras to an\nimaginary map, rather than something pulled from Google Maps or Open Street\nMap. We'll take on the task of plotting features on a landscape from a\npotential role-playing game and show how the GIS data manipulation features,\nsuch as calculating region intersections, nearby points, and javascript\nclient-side display work the in a familiar way against this slightly unusual\nbackground.\n\nSome basic familiarity with Django's GIS features would be useful for this\ntalk, although it might also serve as a motivating introduction to trying\nthings out. The code shown will be available for download after the talk.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "DjangoCon 2010", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": 195686765, "recorded": null, "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/60_maps-of-imaginary-lands.ogv", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.580", "id": 60, "related_urls": [], "slug": "djangocon-2010--maps-of-imaginary-lands", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": []}
