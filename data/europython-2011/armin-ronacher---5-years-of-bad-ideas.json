    "description": "What was my motivation for working with Python after two years of PHP? There\nis so much you can do. Functions are objects you can pass around, you can\ndecompile functions to see how they work internally, you can alias a bound\nmethod to a global function and it will just work. You can change import\nsemantics, override the method resolution order, you can write metaclasses,\nyou can hook into the CPython interpreter API and much more.\n\nFive years later I came to the conclusion that this is really not what Python\nis about and that a lot of what I did was interesting but not necessarily a\ngood idea. This talk is a 45 minute recompilation of things I really shouldn't\nhave done in the first place. Expect a bunch of neat and interesting hacks\nthat showcase the possibilities of the language.\n\n",
