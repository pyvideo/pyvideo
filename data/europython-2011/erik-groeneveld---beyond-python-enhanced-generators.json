    "description": "Right after the introduction of PEP342 (Enhanced Generators) we started to\ndecompose programs into generators. It was soon discovered that for real-life\nproblems one would need something like \"yield from\", as is described in\nPEP380. At that time, we already had a similar solution called\n'[compose](http://weightless.io/compose)', which we adapted to PEP380.\n\nAfter 5 years working with 'compose', we found a small set of other features\nthat are essential if you want to use Enhanced Generators not only as a way of\nlightweight command scheduling, but also a a pipe-line, or parser. Indeed, the\nlatter concepts are what real co-routines are about.\n\nThis talk introduces what is needed on top of PEPs 342 and 380 based on\nexperience with decomposing big enterprise search engines into co-routines.\nParts of it have been presented on SPA (2008) and EuroPython (2010).\nUnderstanding of Enhanced Generators is a prerequisite.\n\nExperience has shown that the topic is subtle enough to require quite some\ntime for full understanding, hence the suggestion for a 90 min slot.\n\n",
