    "description": "Stackless: Recent advancements and future goals\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince Python release 1.5 Stackless Python is an enhanced variant of C-Python.\r\nStackless is best known for its addition of lightweight microthreads (tasklets) and \r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nLess known are the recent enhancements that became available with Stackless 2.7.6. \r\nIn this talk core Stackless developers demonstrate\r\n\r\n * The improved multi-threading support\r\n * How to build custom scheduling primitives based on atomic tasklet operations\r\n * The much improved debugger support\r\n * ...\r\n \r\nStackless recently switched the new master repository from hg.python.org/stackless to bitbucket to \r\nallow for a more open development process. We'll summarise our experience and discuss our\r\nplans for the future development of Stackless.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be help by Anselm Kruis and Christian Tismer.\r\nIf we are lucky, we will also welcome Kristj\u00e1n Valur J\u00f3nsson from Iceland.\r\n",
