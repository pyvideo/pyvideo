At the beginning of the talk, we fire up our Python interpreter and start to explore the library in a structured way. We'll go hands on through the various parts of the SQLAlchemy. We try out the concepts of each part of the library and make sure the basics are well understood.", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-08-01T08:20:09.419", "id": 3008, "related_urls": [{"url": "http://www.conceptive.be/uploads/3/6/7/9/3679389/drill-complete.pdf", "description": "download"}], "slug": "sqlalchemy-drill", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Erik Janssens"]}
