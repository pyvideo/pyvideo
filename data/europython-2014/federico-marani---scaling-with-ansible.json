    "description": "Infrastructure/Scaling is a topic really close to me, I'd like to have the chance to talk about how we set this up in the company I work for. Our infrastructure is around 10-15 servers,  provisioned on different cloud providers, so a good size infrastructure.\r\n\r\nPresentation is going to be divided in 3 parts, first part is going to be focused on comparing sysadmin and devops, then there will be an introduction to the basic concepts of Ansible. I want to spend most on the last part, which is going to give some tips based on our experience with it.\r\n\r\nMany ideas will come from this presentation https://speakerdeck.com/fmarani/devops-with-ansible which i gave at DJUGL in London, with a longer session I will have more chances to delve into more detail, especially on how we use it, from vagrant boxes setup to AWS and DigitalOcean boxes, network configuration, software configurations, etc... \r\n\r\nI want to offer as many real-life tips as possible, without going too much offtopic as far as Ansible is concerned",
