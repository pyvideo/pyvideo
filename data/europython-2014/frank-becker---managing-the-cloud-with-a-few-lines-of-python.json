They should be easily adoptable for similar use cases or serve as an starting point for more different ones.", "state": 1, "category": "EuroPython 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-23", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbKvCvfWcJc", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "One of the advantages of cloud computing is that resources can be enabled or disabled dynamically. \r\nE. g. is an distributed application short on compute power one can easily add more.
