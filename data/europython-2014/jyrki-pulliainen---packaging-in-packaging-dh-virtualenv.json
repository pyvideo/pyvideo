    "description": "[Dh-virtualenv][1] is an open source tool developed at Spotify. We use it\r\nto ease deploying our Python software to production. We built dh-virtualenv as a tool that fits our existing continuous integration flow with a dedicated sbuild server.\r\nAs we were already packaging software in Debian packages, the\r\naim of dh-virtualenv was to make transition to virtualenv based installations as smooth as possible.\r\n\r\nThis talk covers how you can use dh-virtualenv to help you deploy your\r\nsoftware to production, where you are already running a Debian-based system, such as Ubuntu, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of the approach over other existing and\r\npopular techniques. We will discuss the deploying as a problem in\r\ngeneral, look into building a dh-vritualenv-backed package, and in the\r\nend, look into how dh-virtualenv was actually made.\r\n\r\nGoal is that after this presentation you know how to make your Debian/Ubuntu deployments easier!\r\n\r\n[dh-virtualenv][1] if fully open sourced, production tested software,\r\nlicensed under GPLv2+ and available in Debian testing and unstable.\r\n\r\nMore information of it is also available in our [blogpost][2].\r\n\r\n\r\nTalk outline:\r\n\r\n1. Introduction & overview (3min)\r\n    * Who am I?\r\n    * Why am I fiddling with Python packaging?\r\n    * What do you get out of this talk?\r\n2.  Different shortcomings of Python deployments (5min)\r\n    * Native system packages\r\n    * Virtualenv based installations\r\n    * Containers, virtual machine images\r\n3. dh-virtualenv (10 min)\r\n    * What is dh-virtualenv?\r\n    * Thought behind dh-virtualenv\r\n    * Advantages over others\r\n    * Requirements for your deployment flow\r\n    * Short intro to packaging Sentry with dh-virtualenv\r\n4. How is it built? (10 min)\r\n    * Debian package building flow primer\r\n    * How dh-virtualenv fits that flow\r\n    * What does it do build time and why?\r\n\r\n[1]:http://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv\r\n[2]:http://labs.spotify.com/2013/10/10/packaging-in-your-packaging-dh-virtualenv/\r\n",
