    "description": "Can empirical samples unveil the big picture?\r\nIs chess games descriptions expose good enough data to gain understanding of chess rules - legal piece moves, castling, check versus checkmate, etc.\r\nWhich features are important in describing a chess game and which features are not. What is a good representation of a chess game for this uses.\r\nWhat is the minimal sample size which is required in order to learn this in a good enough manner and where this learning can go wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ne3  =>  E=mc2**\r\n\r\nLooking at the bigger picture - Can we understand big systems based on empirical samples.\r\nCan we reverse engineer physics and discover how physical system work based on no external knowledge beside empirical samples.",
