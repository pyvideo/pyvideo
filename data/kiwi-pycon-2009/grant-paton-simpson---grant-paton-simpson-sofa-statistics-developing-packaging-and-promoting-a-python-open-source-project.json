Plus managing releases. \n  * Using Sourceforge, Freshmeat, and Launchpad (including Bazaar) \n  * Promoting the project through blogging, answering posts e.g. Ubuntu, wikipedia, special aggregator lists and reviews, presentations, articles, etc. \n\nQuestions are very welcome as this is a very broad topic.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
