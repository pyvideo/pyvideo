    "description": "A smart introduction to Plone\n\nPresented by Joel Burton\n\nAbstract\n\nThe world of online content management systems has become so enormous that it\ncan be difficult to weigh the advantages--and disadvantages--of the systems.\nThe speaker, a noted Plone author and consultant, will demonstrate the\nfeatureset of Plone, and provide real-world hints on the customer value and\nchallenges it provides.\n\nOutline\n\nHere, you can learn where Plone may serve your needs well, and where it might\nbe overkill or inappropriately deployed. You'll also learn approximate\nbudgets, in time and learning, you'd need to get up to speed on the system. In\naddition, a demonstration of the upcoming features of Plone 4 and a future-\nlooking glance at the radically-redesigned Plone 5 will be given. Recommended\nfor new and casual users of Plone, and for people interested in understanding\nits niche in the CMS/application development world.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n",
