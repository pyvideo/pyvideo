Cylc was developed, entirely in Python, to automate modern environmental forecasting systems in an HPC environment at NIWA in New Zealand. Since its release as an Open Source project on GitHub in 2011 cylc has been adopted by the UK Met Office to control their large and varied forecasting systems; it is also used by groups at the Marine Meteorology Division of the Naval Research Laboratory in the US, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany, and others; and it was a finalist in the 2012 NZ Open Source Awards. Lead developer Hilary Oliver will give an overview of what cylc does and how it works, and the particular advantages gained by our decision to use the Python programming language.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/hilary-james-oliver-the-cylc-suite-engine",
