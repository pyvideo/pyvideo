The talk will cover the basics of Platform as a Service and introduce Red Hat's open source OpenShift PaaS. There will be a demonstration of how to fire up an auto-scaling spatial app with Python and MongoDB on OpenShift. We will then hit the app with some load to experiment with the scaling spatial goodness.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/katie-miller-cloud-craft-for-spatial-cadets\r\n\r\nhttp://cloudcraft.codemiller.com/", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-09-14", "copyright_text": "CC", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/YI9VNrXYIQM", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-10-16T00:06:08.844", "id": 3216, "related_urls": [], "slug": "cloud-craft-for-spatial-cadets", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Katie Miller"]}
