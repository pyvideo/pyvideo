Serve large spikes in search request traffic. Allow students to find course reviews across multiple universities and countries.\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\n - introduction to the real world problem - Students need to be able to find university courses across multiple countries and universities.\r\n - first - explore how to solve the problem - collect course data & decide on a rough solution\r\n - second - create minimum viable product & see how people use it. Iteratively make it better.\r\n - second continued: Organise a big website launch event before you've created the website - then proceed to write 10K lines of code in the week before launch.\r\n - third - analyse the 50K most recent search terms & make a simple tree data structure to help improve search performance.\r\n - four - caching & cache invalidation\r\n - five - Maybe I'll do an online marketing campaign halfway through the talk and show graphs of the app responding in real time.\r\n\r\n - Covers Data analysis with python (csv, matplotlib, networkx, collections.Counter, logfile parsing)\r\n\r\n - Covers \"Futures\" - doing RPC calls in parallel.\r\n - Unit testing & simulating all things. - Being able to see how adjusting search functionality effects query times & quality of results.\r\n\r\n - Some tasteful jokes to keep things entertaining ;)\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/robert-king-making-a-scalable-course-search-engine-with-python", "state": 1, "category": "Kiwi PyCon 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-09-14", "copyright_text": "CC", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/568mFzqsjqk", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-10-16T00:06:40.433", "id": 3234, "related_urls": [], "slug": "making-a-scalable-course-search-engine-with-pytho", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Robert King"]}
