    "description": "[SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython) is a Python module which allows executed Python to generate OpenSCAD script. [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) is software for creating solid 3D CAD models. OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller, instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object and renders the 3D model from this script file.\r\n\r\n[Cura](https://github.com/daid/Cura) is the Python-based user interface to the CuraEngine slicing library, which processes 3D models into 3D printing instructions for various printers.\r\n\r\n[BotQueue](https://www.botqueue.com/) is a 3D printing job-control service, allowing remote submission and monitoring of printing jobs to any number of printers.\r\n\r\nThis talk will take a tour through SolidPython, Cura, and BotQueue showing how Python can help with the design, preparation, and printing of your doodad, widget, or dingus.",
