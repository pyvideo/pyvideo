We built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala, and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a clever way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are Scala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over three years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with cloud computing technologies.", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon APAC 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-06-27", "copyright_text": "youtube", "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoPCxpQaxc", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-10-26T17:14:29.723", "id": 3271, "related_urls": [], "slug": "how-to-integrate-python-into-a-scala-stack-to-bui", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "", "language": "Chinese", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Jerry Chou"]}
