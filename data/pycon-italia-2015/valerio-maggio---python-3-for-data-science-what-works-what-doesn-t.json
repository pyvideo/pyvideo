    "description": "In the last years, the Python programming language has engaged a \nmajor renovation, and Python 3.x is going to be the next generation reference\nof the language.\nHowever, despite the community strives to support the language switch \namong pythonistas, Python 3 is not yet the real de-facto reference version \nof the language and Python 2.x is still on the go.\nMoreover, as for the scientific Python community, only few years ago most \nof the scientific python packages only (or mainly) supported Python 2.\nIn this talk we will analyse how far the support to Python 3 extent to the \nPython scientific packages, emphasising what actually works and \nwhat doesn\u2019t.\nThe general claim of this talk is that, from a technical perspective, Python 3 \nis a more mature language from many point of view (w.r.t. Python 2), \nand the scientific community is now able more than ever to switch to Python 3. \nHowever, so far, the switch has not been done yet. \nThus, some reflections on this \u201cparticular\u201d community of pythonistas will \nconclude the talk in order to stimulate the discussion and derive together \npossible solutions and \u201cworkaround\u201d to support this change.\n",
