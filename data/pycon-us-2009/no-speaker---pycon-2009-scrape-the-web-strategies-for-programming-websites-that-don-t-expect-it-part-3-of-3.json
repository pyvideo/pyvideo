Would\nyour life be simpler if you could programmatically input data into web\napplications, even those tuned to resist interaction by bots? We'll discuss\nthe basics of web scraping, and then dive into the details of different\nmethods and where they are most applicable. You'll leave with an understanding\nof when to apply different tools, and learn about a \"heavy hammer\" for screen\nscraping that I picked up at a project for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nAtendees should bring a laptop, if possible, to try the examples we discuss\nand optionally take notes.\n\n",
