    "description": "Powerful Pythonic Patterns video\n\nPresented by Alex Martelli\n\nAn extremely misguided meme is going around: that Python doesn't have, or\nneed, any Design Patterns. Maybe the meme springs from not realizing what the\nGang Of Four state so plainly in their historical \"Design Patterns\" book:\nwhich design patterns are useful DOES depend on the programming language one\ntargets -- design is NOT independent of implementation, as the epic-fail\n\"Waterfall\" Methodology Pattern would suggest. If you examine a \"classic DP\"\nthat's basically a workaround for some other language's lack of garbage\ncollection, or for a clumsy static-typing system, it may indeed be worthless\nfor Python. But many other DPs are still perfectly useful and applicable, and\nindeed Python's strengths as a language afford riffing on them to develop\nhighly Pythonic, powerful, productive variants.\n\nIn this talk, I analyze some of my favorite pattern families -- e.g., Template\nMethod and its variants, Dependency Injection and its ilk, Callback and\nfriends -- in a highly Pythonic context. Non-pattern Idioms, and Patterns that\naren't really Design Patterns but rather Architecture or Methodology ones,\nalso make cameo appearances.\n\n",
