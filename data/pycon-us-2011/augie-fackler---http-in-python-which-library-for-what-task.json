It's well\nworth knowing the options and tradeoffs available.\n\nAbstract\n\nHTTP in Python is very much a mixed bag of available technology. What's\nimplemented mostly works well, but there are some frustrating gaps in\ndifferent libraries that are poorly documented. I've gone wading through every\nHTTP library I can find for Python while trying to fix an obscure bug in\nMercurial and decided to write my own. I'll cover what's available today and\nwhy I'm starting from scratch with a completely new implementation.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyCon US 2011", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/439_http-in-python-which-library-for-what-task.mp4", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2011-03-11", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 84877399, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.990", "id": 439, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pycon-2011--http-in-python--which-library-for-wha", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Augie Fackler"]}
