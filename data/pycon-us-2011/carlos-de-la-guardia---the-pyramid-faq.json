    "description": "The Pyramid FAQ\n\nPresented by Carlos de la Guardia\n\nThe #pylons IRC channel is the most common way of giving support to users of\nthe Pyramid framework. In this talk we take away some of the most often\ndiscussed topics in the channel and give detailed answers to them.\n\nAbstract\n\nEvery development project has a few questions and doubts that seem to come up\non its support channels every now and then. The Pyramid framework is no\nexception.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce Pyramid related FAQs using the chat logs and\nproceed to discuss them in detail. Showing the logs allows us to give the talk\na lighter side and makes for an introduction to each topic based on real user\nquestions.\n\nTopics covered here include:\n\n  * Configuration objects. \n  * Object traversal versus URL dispatch. \n  * Context and views. \n  * Authentication and authorization. \n  * How much 'Zope stuff' is there in Pyramid and can we take it away? \n  * Examples of how Pyramid enables the Pylons philosophy of integrating best of breed or preferred components. \n  * The future of Pyramid and Pylons. \n\n",
