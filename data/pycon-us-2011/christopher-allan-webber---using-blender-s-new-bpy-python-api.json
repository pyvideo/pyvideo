    "description": "Since 2.5, the API has become more pythonic and self-descriptive. Blender's UI\ncan show you the Python equivalent for nearly every user action and includes a\nfull datablock exploration tool. Users will be taught how to use so they can\nquickly adapt to their appropriate needs with a little Blender experience and\nno previous BPY experience.\n\nThere will be a brief Blender overview, an introduction to the API and how to\nuse it, as well as / along with an overview of some of the presenter's own\ntools / use cases. Some other popular 3rd party Python tools will also be\nshown as an example.\n\nIf there is time, a brief demo of the Blender Game Engine will also be given,\nthough that is a separate API.\n\n",
