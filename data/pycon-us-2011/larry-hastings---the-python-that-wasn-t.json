    "description": "The Python That Wasn't\n\nPresented by Larry Hastings\n\nOne reason for Python's success is its restraint in adding new language\nfeatures. Only the most essential changes make it--and for every change that\ngets accepted, many more are rejected. Come learn about proposed changes to\nthe Python language that failed--what, how, and why.\n\nAbstract\n\n  * Quick overview of the process \n    * First ten years: send GvR a patch \n    * The modern approach: python-ideas, write a PEP, produce a reference implementation \n  * Discuss the \"prickly\" Python community \n    * This is a good thing! Only the best ideas survive the python-dev gauntlet! \n    * They do this not because they're mean, but because they care so much. \n    * We must have eternal vigilance to prevent unnecessary changes! \n  * A survey of some changes that didn't make it \n    * The switch/case statement (PEP 3103) \n    * The \"freeze protocol\" (PEP 351) \n    * The \"dynamic attribute access\" proposal from python-dev, 2007/02 \n    * Many more possibilities await in the rejected PEPs! \n  * My message to the audience \n    * Start with a post to python-ideas, please! \n    * Don't be surprised if you get a negative reaction \n    * Don't let your fear of a negative reaction stop you from trying, necessarily \n    * Do your homework, and be your own worst critic \n\n",
