    "description": "In this talk we would like to have a short introduction on how Python\r\nprograms are compiled and executed, with special attention towards\r\njust-in-time compilation done by PyPy. PyPy is the most advanced Python\r\ninterpreter around, and while it should generally just speed up your programs,\r\nthere is a wide range of performance that you can get out of PyPy, ranging from\r\nslightly faster than CPython to C speeds, depending on how you write your\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nWe will split the talk in two parts. In the first part we will explain\r\nhow things work, and what can and cannot be optimized, as well as describe\r\nthe basic heuristics of the JIT compiler and optimizer. In the next part we will\r\ndo a brief survey of existing tools for looking at performance of Python programs,\r\nwith a specific focus on PyPy. We'll mostly focus on vmprof with a brief mention of others.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this talk, an audience member should be better equipped with\r\nthe tools to write new software and improve existing software with performance\r\nin mind.\r\n",
