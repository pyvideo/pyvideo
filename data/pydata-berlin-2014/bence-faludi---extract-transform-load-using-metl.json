The main advantage to configurable via Yaml files and You have the possibility to write any transformation in Python and You can use it natively from any framework as well. We are using this tool in production for many of our clients and It is really stable and reliable. The project has a few contributors all around the world right now and I hope many developer will join soon. I really want to show you how you can use it in your daily work.
