As part of my work I use python and scientific librairies ( pandas, scikit\u00adlearn) on a daily basis as it is used both on our backend services as well as for Data analysis. We tackle complex problems such as Dynamic Pricing depending on local demand an supply, dispatching Drivers efficiently, Matching multiple passenger routes together for or real time ride\u00adsharing product Lyft Line, real\u00adtime ETAs and traffic estimation\u2026 The fact that a lot of or analyses use geolocation data adds a specific component to it that leads to complex problems.
