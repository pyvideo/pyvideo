The material on the\n[http://pystar.org](http://pystar.org/) site was originally developed by the\nBoston Python Workshop which was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently PyStar events\nuse a mix of badges from the PyStar site and their own curriculum. As this\nproject continues hopefully this site will be a hub of learning materials\ngeared at all levels of Python learners, with a focus on teaching people in a\nsafe and supportive manner.\n\n",
