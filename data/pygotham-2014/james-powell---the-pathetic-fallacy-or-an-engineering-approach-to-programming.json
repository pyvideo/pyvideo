    "description": "Software programming is a young discipline, placed somewhere between the rigorous world of mathematics and the pragmatic world of engineering. As evidence of its immaturity as a discipline, consider how frequently the same problems arise in the practice of writing a programme, and how these problems are unaccompanied by widely-disseminated conceptualisations or a commonly agreed-upon pathology or even a well-defined guiding philosophy and epistemology. In other words, we keep running into the same problems, and we often lack even a basis for discussing them (much less avoiding them)!",
