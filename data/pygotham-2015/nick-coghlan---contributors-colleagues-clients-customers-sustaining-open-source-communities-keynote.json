Have a significant impact on the world by being\r\nable to commit full time to growing the available pool of free & open\r\nsource software? Spend time getting to know the needs of a particular\r\norganisation, and applying open source tools to solve their problems?\r\nOr perhaps you'd prefer to understand the general needs of a broad\r\ncategory of potential users, and design open source tools that will\r\nsolve their problems without customisation?\r\n\r\nGetting involved in open source development communities can offer all\r\nthese opportunities and more, but it also makes it incredibly easy for\r\nus to overcommit and burn ourselves out. If we're not careful, our\r\nunrealistic expectations can also contribute to the burnout of our\r\npeers. To ensure sustainability, we need to come to a shared\r\nunderstanding of some of the different ways we can engage with open\r\nsource communities, what we can reasonably offer for free, and what we\r\nshould expect to be paid for.", "state": 1, "category": "PyGotham 2015", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3764_Contributors_Colleagues_Clients_Customers_Sustaini.mp4", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2015-08-15", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "source_url": "http://youtu.be/LM4oNXTSpfE", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2015-08-16T15:14:12.657", "id": 3764, "related_urls": [], "slug": "contributors-colleagues-clients-customers-su", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Nick Coghlan"]}
