Bring a computer with Python installed if you want to\nplay along.\n\n", "state": 1, "category": "PyOhio 2010", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": null, "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 105368731, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.844", "id": 511, "related_urls": [], "slug": "pyohio-2010--so-you-just-took--quot-python-101-qu", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pyohio-2010/511_pyohio-2010-so-you-just-took-python-101-what-s-next.flv", "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": ["Greg Lindstrom"]}
