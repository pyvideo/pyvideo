    "description": "In the last month, we've started an effort to aggregate our logs so we can do\nsome real-time, holistic log analysis. Among other things, we are tracking\nfailed logins across all points of entry, identifying possibly compromised\naccounts (simultaneous logins from multiple IPs, geographically disparate\nlogins), and identifying high-volume mailers across multiple mail relays. The\ntalk will include an introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL, data structures,\nquerying, indexing, differences from relational databases, etc); some\nimportant performance and reliability features like its support for replica\nsets, sharding, and map/reduce; and some very cool features like GridFS and\ngeospatial indexing. All of this, with the exception of database\nconfiguration, will be demoed with MongoDB's python client.\n\n",
