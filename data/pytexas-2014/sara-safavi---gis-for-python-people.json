    "description": "It seems like everyone is talking about GIS lately, but what exactly is it, anyway? And more importantly: as a Python user, why should you care? \r\n\r\nThis talk's goal is twofold: first, to try and demystify the basic idea of \"GIS\" for people who are interested in the topic and are coming from a Python background. I'll cover general GIS concepts, talk about spatial data, and what makes it unique. Second, to show how you might be able to use and integrate GIS into your work. I'll go over some of the more common Python tools available for working with GIS data, and show examples of use-cases. Although I'll briefly touch on major GIS industry players, my main focus will be on easily-accessible, free & open source tools.\r\n\r\nThis is an all-levels talk: like the title says, this is for \"Python People\"! Whether you consider yourself a seasoned Python developer, an enthusiastic fan, or are just getting started: you should be able to learn something new while following along with the concepts & examples I'll discuss.
