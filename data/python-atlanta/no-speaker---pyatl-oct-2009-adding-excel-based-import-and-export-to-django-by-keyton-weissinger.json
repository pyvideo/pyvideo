    "description": "\"In this presentation I will talk about a simple addition to any django\napplication that will allow your end users to, in essence, check out a large\nnumber of items, update them en masse using Excel (where they can take the\ndata offline and sort to their heart's content), and then check them all in\nagain.\n\n\"This same system also allows for Excel-based batch import -- an added bonus.\nAnd, of course, it works if you're spreadsheet of choice is Open Office as\nwell.\n\n\"This presentation shows you how to add this functionality to any django\nproject quickly and easily using some simple model decoration, an openly\navailable drop-in reusable django application and the excellent libraries xlrd\nand xlwt.\"\n\n",

Unfortunately,\nbuilding a grid-like user interface in a webpage to allow for this type of\nediting is often painful and results in a poor substitute for Excel, the\nstandard against which some of these same end users will compare it. Why not\njust let 'em use Excel?\n\n",
