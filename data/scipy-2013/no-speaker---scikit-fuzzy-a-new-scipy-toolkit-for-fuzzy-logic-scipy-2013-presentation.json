This area has been a challenge for the scientific Python community, largely because the common first exposure to this topic is through the MATLAB\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122. This talk officially introduces a general set of original fuzzy logic algorithms to the scientific Python community which predate the commercial toolbox, were released under the 3-clause BSD license, and were translated to Python by an author who never used the MathWorks\u00c2\u00ae Fuzzy Logic Toolbox\u2122.\n\nThe current capabilities of scikit-fuzzy include: fuzzy membership function generation; fuzzy set operations; lambda-cuts; fuzzy mathematics including Zadeh's extension principle, the vertex method, and the DSW method; fuzzy implication given an IF THEN system of fuzzy rules (via Mamdani [min] or Larsen [product] implication); various defuzzification algorithms; fuzzy c-means clustering; and Fuzzy Inference Ruled by Else-action (FIRE) denoising of 1d or 2d signals.\n\nThe goals of scikit-fuzzy are to provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and implemented fuzzy logic algorithms, filling a void in the capabilities of scientific and numerical Python, and to increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to closed-source options. Scikit-fuzzy is structured similarly to scikit-learn and scikit-image, current source code is available on GitHub, and pull requests are welcome.", "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.365", "id": 2019, "related_urls": [], "slug": "scikit-fuzzy-a-new-scipy-toolkit-for-fuzzy-logic", "quality_notes": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "speakers": []}
