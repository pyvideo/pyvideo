The principal goals of Bokeh are to provide capability to developers and domain experts:\r\n\r\n* easily create novel and powerful visualizations\r\n* that extract insight from remote, possibly large data sets\r\n* published to the web for others to explore and interact\r\n\r\nThis talk will describe how the architecture of Bokeh enables these goals, and demonstrate how it can be leveraged by anyone using python for analysis to visualize and present their work. We will talk about current development and future plans, including a brief discussion of Joseph Cottam's exciting academic work on abstract rendering for large data sets that is going into Bokeh (https://github.com/JosephCottam/AbstractRendering).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "state": 1, "category": "SciPy 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-09", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9NpLOyp-dI", "video_webm_url": null, "summary": "Bokeh is a Python visualization library for large datasets that natively uses the latest web technologies.
