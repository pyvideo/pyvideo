Large, private organizations have been grappling with this issue for a while, spawning a great deal of enthusiasm around tools like Docker, Puppet, Vagrant, and Packer. And let\u2019s not forget notable python-based upstarts, Ansible and Salt! These tools can generate immense enthusiasm, followed by the question, \u201cWhy are we doing this?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe problem is that researcher / developers can become overwhelmed by the complexity and variety inherent in devops tools - all the while losing sight of the real reason for using these tools: a philosophy of documenting your research compute environments in a reproducible fashion, with a focus on scripting as much as is reasonable.\r\n\r\nAt UC Berkeley, members of the D-Lab, the Statistical Compute Facility, Computer Science and Research IT have organized a project to develop the Berkeley Common Environment (BCE). I\u2019ll provide an overview of the challenges we\u2019ve tackled in both educational and research contexts, and the needs served by the above-mentioned devops tools. In the end, I argue that a coherent, easy-to-understand philosophy around scientific compute environments is fundamental - the tools are just a way to make your collaboration architecture a little easier for the people building these environments a few times a year. What we should focus on, though, is end-user experience and research community buy-in.", "state": 1, "category": "SciPy 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-09", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7jaZ5SFvFk", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "I provide an overview of the challenges we\u2019ve tackled at UC Berkeley deploying scientific compute environments in both educational and research contexts.
