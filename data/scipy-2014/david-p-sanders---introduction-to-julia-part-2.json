    "description": "Julia is a new, up-and-coming language that has many similarities to Python, but some differences.\r\nOne of its main advantages is the speed gain obtained by automatically compiling all code (in a somewhat similar way to `PyPy`, `Cython`, `numba`, etc.), despite having an interactive interface very similar to that of Python. \r\n\r\nThis will be a tutorial on the basic features of Julia from scratch, given by a user (rather than a developer) of the language, emphasising those features which are similar to Python (and hence do not require much explanation) and those features which are rather different. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the tutorial is to give an idea of why there is suddenly such a buzz around Julia and why it can be useful for certain projects.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is aimed at people who are already familiar with the basic scientific Python packages; it is not aimed at beginners in scientific programming.",
