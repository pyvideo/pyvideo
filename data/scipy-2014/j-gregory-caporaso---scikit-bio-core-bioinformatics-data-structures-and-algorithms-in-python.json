    "description": "Python is widely used in computational biology, with many high profile bioinformatics software projects, such as [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/), [Khmer](http://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [QIIME](http://www.qiime.org), being largely or entirely written in Python. We present [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org), a new library based on the standard Python scientific computing stack (e.g., numpy, scipy, and matplotlib) implementing core bioinformatics data structures, algorithms, parsers, and formatters. scikit-bio is the first bioinformatics-centric [scikit](https://scikits.appspot.com/), and arises from over ten years of development efforts on [PyCogent](http://www.pycogent.org) and [QIIME](http://www.qiime.org), representing an effort to update the functionality provided by these extensively used tools, and to make that functionality more accessible. scikit-bio is intended to be useful both as a resource for students, who can learn topics such as heuristic-based sequence database searching or iterative progressive multiple sequence alignment from the source code and accompanying documentation, and as a powerful library for 'real-world' bioinformatics developers. To achieve these goals, scikit-bio development is centered around test-driven, peer-reviewed software development; C/Cython integration for computationally expensive algorithms; extensive API documentation and doc-testing based on the [numpy docstring standards](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt); user documentation and [theoretical discussion of topics in IPython Notebooks](http://caporasolab.us/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics/); adherence to PEP8; and continuous integration testing. scikit-bio is available free of charge under the BSD license.\r\n",
