    "description": "Good solutions to hard problems require both domain and algorithmic expertise.\r\nDomain experts know *what* to do and computer scientists know *how* to do it\r\nwell.  Coordination between the algorithmic and domain programmer is \r\nchallenging to do well and difficult to scale.  It is also arguably one of the\r\nmost relevant blocks to scientific progress today.\r\n\r\nThis talk draws from experience supporting mathematical programmers in the\r\nSymPy project.  SymPy is a computer algebra system, a complex problem that\r\nrequires the graph manipulation algorithms of a modern compiler alongside the           mathematics of several PhD theses.  SymPy draws from a broad developer base\r\nwith experienced and novice developers alike and so struggles to maintain a\r\ncohesive organized codebase.\r\n\r\nWe approach this development problem by separating software engineering\r\ninto a collection of small functions, written by domain experts, alongside an\r\nabstract control system, written by algorithmic programmers.  We facilitate\r\nthis division with techniques taken from other languages and compiler \r\ntechnologies.  Notably we motivate the use of a few general purpose libraries\r\nfor multiple dispatch, pattern matching, and programmatic control.\r\n",
