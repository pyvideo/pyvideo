Like many similar institutions around the world, financial\r\nrestrictions play a significant role in limiting what tools are available to\r\nscientists. It was from this need to stay scientifically current, while keeping\r\nthe software inexpensive, that the examination of Python first started and\r\nultimately ended up in the PyGMI project.\r\n\r\nThe origins of PyGMI started with two separate projects. The first was a joint\r\nproject where the CGS was responsible for the creation of a software interface\r\nfor cluster analysis code, developed by the University of Potsdam (Paasche et\r\nal 2009). The resulting project was done entirely in Python. Data could be\r\nimported, filtered, analyzed and displayed in graph form using Matplotlib.\r\n\r\nThe second project stemmed from the need to perform 3D modelling on geophysical\r\ndata. The creation of 3D models can be extremely time-consuming. Packages\r\navailable tend to follow either the modelling of individual 2.5D profiles,\r\nwhich are then joined up into 3D sections, or modelling fully in\r\nthree dimensions using polygonal based models. The initial idea was to use the\r\nVTK library as the means to create, display and interrogate the model, while\r\nusing the Scipy and Numpy libraries to perform the actual potential field\r\ncalculations. It soon became apparent that editing the resulting mesh quickly\r\nbecame complex and time consuming. The ability to easily create and change a\r\nmodel is the very basis of forward modelling and for this reason a new approach\r\nwas adopted. The newer 3D modelling package was designed to allow the user to\r\nmodel simply by drawing the model, in the same way one would draw views of a\r\nhouse using a paint program. This implies the need to have a front view, as\r\nwell as a top view. The model is therefore voxel based rather than polygonal.\r\nThe final model can be displayed either within the PyGMI software, or exported\r\nto Google Earth for examination.\r\n\r\nUltimately these two projects formed the basis of what is now the actual PyGMI\r\npackage -- which is a modular collection of various techniques, including\r\nmultivariate statistical analysis and potential field modelling. The interface\r\nfollows a flow diagram approach and the individual modules are independent\r\nenough to ensure that they do not interfere with code which has preceded them\r\nin previous modules.\r\n\r\nThe PyGMI software is available for free download at: [https://code.google.com/p/pygmi/](https://code.google.com/p/pygmi/)\r\n", "state": 1, "category": "SciPy 2014", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_flv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_webm_length": null, "video_mp4_length": null, "recorded": "2014-07-14", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kM3tKkjoSw", "video_webm_url": "", "summary": "The development of geophysical software by individual scientists is achievable through languages such as Python.
